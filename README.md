##Description
The R code in run_analysis.R performs analysis of the dataset, as indicated in the script, according to the following instructions:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Variables
* subject - numerical ID for subjects participating in the study
* activity - labels for the different activities, as defined by study
* remaining variables are mean/standard deviation of measurements recorded by study participants
